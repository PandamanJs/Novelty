Your story is organized in a clear hierarchy:

│  │  ├─ Scene (Scene A, Scene B, etc.)
│  │  └─ [Each scene has status, word count, notes]
│  └─ Chapter (...)
└─ Section (...)
```

#### Scene Statuses

Each scene has a status to track progress:

- 🔘 **Draft**: Initial scene outline or rough draft
- 🟦 **In Progress**: Currently being written or revised
